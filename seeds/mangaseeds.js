    title:'Let\'s Buy The Land And Cultivate In Different World',
    author:'Jun Sasameyuki - Murakami Yuichi - Rokujuuyon Okazawa',
    description:'As our humble corporatist Itonami Norio is suddenly summoned to another world, it would look as if he\'ll be sent to a battlefield-- he, however, holds no skill to speak of, and as he is deemed to be useless. He negotiates with The King and receives a plot of land -- an empty, deserted plot of land, with no inhabitant in sight. Norio holds something he couldn\'t bring himself to tell anyone: The Master of Supremacy, a gift which will grant him the most comfortable of lives in this world. Hereby begins the Norio\'s colorful story -- having a mermaid he fishes declare herself his wife, becoming neighbors with the Undead King, this is his busy but enjoyable life -- and now a dragon appears ?!',
